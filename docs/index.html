      <a href="https://np.ironhelmet.com/">Neptune's Pride</a> is a 4x space

      Neptune's Pride Agent (or NPA) is a fan-built extension that injects
      javascript into the game to speed up in-game decision making and eliminate
      many tedious calculation or UI navigation tasks. NPA consists of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A heads-up display (HUD) for battle and scanning info</li>
      <li>Globally modified timestamps for easier planning</li>
      <li>New linkable elements for in-game messaging</li>
      <li>Multiple report screens for review or sharing</li>
      <li>Extensive API key support for easier alliance management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      NPA can be installed on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. The easiest way is to
      install the

        >Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store</a
      >
      or the

        href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/neptune-s-pride-agent/"
        >Firefox extension from addons.mozilla.org</a
      >. It is possible to install on Android and iOS but the process is a
      little bit more complicated than on desktop.
